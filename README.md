# WeDont-c---First-Game

Here you can see, use and help improve some code we made for our game.
We will put more code in the near future, that code in particular was created but never used in this project, still could be helpful.
Also, there is some art, but it belongs to Lucas, if you want to use it, please, ask us first.
Furthermore, the game as made in monogame. 
We are freshmen in Video Games Engenering in IPCA, Barcelos Portugal
